# Procedural World Generator

## Overview
This project is a procedural world generator that dynamically creates an infinite game world using random terrain generation. The world consists of different biomes such as water, grass, and mountains.

## Features
- Random terrain generation
- Infinite world expansion
- Different biomes represented by colors

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Pygame

## Installation
1. Install dependencies:
```sh
pip install pygame
```
2. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/procedural-world-generator.git
cd procedural-world-generator
```

## Running the Program
Run the following command:
```sh
python procedural_world_generator.py
```

## How It Works
- Each tile in the world is assigned a biome based on random noise.
